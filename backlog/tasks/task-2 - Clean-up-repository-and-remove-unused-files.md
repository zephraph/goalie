## Description

The repository may contain temporary files, build artifacts, or unused code that adds clutter and makes the codebase harder to navigate. Cleaning up these files will improve code maintainability, reduce repository size, and make it easier for developers to focus on the essential code.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All temporary and build artifacts are removed
- [x] Unused source files are identified and removed
- [x] Directory structure is clean and organized
- [x] No essential files are accidentally removed
- [x] Git history remains intact

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze repository structure to identify temporary files and build artifacts
2. Review source files to identify unused code
3. Check .gitignore to ensure proper patterns are in place
4. Remove identified temporary files (.DS_Store, build artifacts)
5. Clean up unused source files while preserving essential code
6. Organize directory structure if needed
7. Run tests to ensure nothing essential was removed
8. Update .gitignore if necessary

## Implementation Notes

**Approach taken:**
- Conducted comprehensive analysis of repository structure to identify temporary files and unused code
- Systematically removed .DS_Store files (macOS temporary files) that were scattered throughout the repository
- Identified and removed unused template files (main.ts and main_test.ts in root) that were remnants from Deno initialization

**Features implemented or modified:**
- Removed all .DS_Store files from the repository
- Deleted unused root-level main.ts and main_test.ts template files
- Verified .gitignore properly excludes temporary files and build artifacts

**Technical decisions and trade-offs:**
- Confirmed that build artifacts (bin/ directory) are properly git-ignored, so they don't need manual removal
- Preserved the goals/ directory with .gitkeep as it's needed for application functionality
- Verified that src/main.ts is the actual application entry point, not the root main.ts

**Modified or added files:**
- Deleted: main.ts (unused Deno template file)
- Deleted: main_test.ts (unused Deno template test file)
- Deleted: Multiple .DS_Store files throughout the repository
- The application functionality remains fully intact and tested
